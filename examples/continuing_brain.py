"""One System 1 life through bootstrap, disruption, correction and continued use.

Run from this checkout: PYTHONPATH=src python examples/continuing_brain.py
The example uses the current source API, including Brain.last_settlement.

Two sensory cues have observed action labels. The independent environment
rewards the action actually executed, then changes its rule during the same
life. The body reveals the observed target after execution. During bootstrap
and repair, the application repeats a mistaken cue and teaches that witnessed
target. Successful actions receive their actual reward without a teacher.
This application policy does not gate reward learning or memory writes.
Brain.compose supplies reciprocal regions, working trace and consolidating
memory. Optional observers can extend the same graph. Teaching uses the default
finite rule; qualified teaching is an explicit choice.

Each executed action retains its free-answer residual and sweep count. Recorded
step sweeps also include feedback, teaching and reward eligibility, but exclude
residual checks, memory work and optimizer work. They are not joules or total
computation. Recording itself adds overhead and uses the inspectable CPU path.
Outcome counts describe this short run, not demonstrated acquisition, recovery,
or long-term retention. See docs/world-model.md for the integration boundaries.
