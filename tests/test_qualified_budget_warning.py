"""A qualified nudged budget below the free budget warns and names itself on refusal.

Issue 123: `Brain.compose` keeps `nudged_steps=12` as the finite teaching law,
but under `qualified=True` that number becomes a settle budget and every
realistic lesson is refused with no hint that the budget, not the data, is the
cause. The configuration now warns at construction and the refusal names the
mismatch. Finite teaching and deliberately small qualified budgets remain.
