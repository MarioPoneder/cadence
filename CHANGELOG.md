# Changelog

## 0.70.0 — 2026-10-02

- Make System 1 the default continuing brain, with working trace, fast and
  persistent associative memory, plasticity, action and private imagination.
- Provide `Brain.compose` for reciprocal base modules and optional
  System 2 observer regions within the same neural graph.
- Add `Brain.imagine` for private responses to supplied hypothetical
  observations. Learned environmental consequences and action planning use
  the temporal-model API.
- Qualify actions and independent predictions against the full state equations.
  Refusal preserves action state and pending feedback; real outcomes learned
  before a subsequent refusal remain learned.
- Use bounded numerical damping when a free solve needs it, then check the
  original model's residual. The total budget and finite teaching rule stay fixed.
- Provide event records and consolidation, learned temporal paths, continuous
  action planning and finite response protection through advanced APIs.
- Keep exact state-and-error feedback available in the advanced population solver.
- Simplify guides around current usage. This is experimental software; backward
  compatibility is not a design requirement. NumPy is required, with optional
  acceleration backends.
